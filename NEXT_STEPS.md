## ðŸ’¡ Architecture Decisions Needed

1. **Privacy Approach**
   - Process data locally vs cloud?
   - What data to store vs analyze only?
   - Encryption strategy?

2. **ML Model Strategy**
   - Use GPT-4 for analysis vs train custom models?
   - Fine-tuning approach?
   - Real-time vs batch processing?

3. **Data Storage**
   - Vector DB choice (Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector)?
   - How long to retain raw data?
   - Backup strategy?
